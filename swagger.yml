    # Introduction

    Welcome to the reference for the Outcome Measures Self Service System (OMSSS) REST API.

    For a description of the OMSSS system please refer to the [OMSSS documentation](https://docs.omsss.online/) website.

    The OMSSS REST API enables Outcome Measure integration into client management systems. It has been developed by [Strategic Data Pty. Ltd.](https://www.strategicdata.com.au/) on behalf of the Australian [Department of Health](https://health.gov.au/) as part of the [Primary Mental Health Care Minimum Data Set](https://pmhc-mds.com) (PMHC MDS). Although it was originally developed as part of the PMHC MDS project it can also be used to collection outcome measure data that is not subject to the data collection requirements of the PMHC MDS.

    Please send any feedback or questions about this API to <a href="mailto:support@omsss.online">support@omsss.online</a>.

    # Access to the API

    In order to obtain an account to access the OMSSS REST API, please contact <a href="mailto:support@omsss.online">support@omsss.online</a>.

    The OMSSS REST API is available at the following endpoints:

    | Instance    | Base URL for REST Endpoints                    |
    |-------------|------------------------------------------------|
    | Production  | https://api.omsss.online/{version}/            |
    | Developers  | https://developers.api.omsss.online/{version}/ |

    The Production instance provides access to your live data. The Developers instance runs the same version of OMSSS as the Production instance, but can be used to test your code without affecting your live data.

    Your login will give you access to both instances.

    # Authentication

    Please contact <a href="mailto:support@omsss.online">support@omsss.online</a> to obtain login details.

    Integrators authenticate to the OMSSS REST API by providing the following
    parameters in the HTTP Request Headers:

    | Measure             | A diagnostic tool used in healthcare. In the case of OMSSS these are all questionnaires. |
    | Collection          | An instance of a **measure** assigned to a particular **client**.                        |
    | Registration System | A third party system (including the PMHC MDS) that has an API connection to OMSSS.       |

    # Process

    ## Requesting a new Collection

    <img alt="Requesting a new collection from OMSSS REST API" src="https://go.gliffy.com/go/share/image/sy89m0t6rjorv3g412jq.png?utm_medium=live-embed&utm_source=custom" /><p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Requesting a new collection from OMSSS REST API</span></p>

    In order to create a new collection in OMSSS the Registration System sends
    a request to the OMSSS system using the REST API endpoint
    <a href="#operation/Collection::create">POST /collection</a> . This request
    will include a URL and optional payload that the OMSSS system can use to
    inform the Registration System that the client has completed the measure.
    The paylod can be used to include information that the Registration System
    can use to identify which client has completed the measure.

    The OMSSS system will create a new collection. Depending on the parameters
    that have been used in the <a href="#operation/Collection::create">POST /collection</a>
    call it will optionally email a QR code and link to the client or SMS a link
    to the client.

    The OMSSS system will then send a response to the Registration System. The
    response includes a unique number that the Registration System will use to
    query the OMSSS system for the collection results. It also includes a
    shortcode that the client can use to access the collection as well as a link
    to the collection and a URL to a QR code that can be used to access a collection.

    The registration system can then use these display these links back to the
    user of the registration system so that they can be used to allow the client
    to fill out the measure on either a mobile device or desktop computer in a
    practitioners office.

    ## Retrieving Collection Results

    <img alt="Retrieving Collection results using the OMSSS REST API" src="https://go.gliffy.com/go/share/image/sycpgkna5r1nhmgulkni.png?utm_medium=live-embed&utm_source=custom" /><p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Retrieving Collection results using the OMSSS REST API</span></p>

    When the client has completed the measure the OMSSS system will use the
    postback URL and payload that was provided in the
    <a href="#operation/Collection::create">POST /collection</a> call to
    inform the Registration System that the measure has been complete.

    The Registration System can then use the <a href="#operation/Collection::result">GET /collection/{uuid}/result</a>
    endpoint to obtain the results of the collection.

    ## Sending Results to Provider Organisations and Practitioners

    <img alt="Sending results to Provider Organisations and Practitioners using the OMSSS REST API" src="https://go.gliffy.com/go/share/image/sjt56nks19jd7yer4rir.png?utm_medium=live-embed&utm_source=custom" /><p class="caption"><span class="caption-text">Sending results to Provider Organisations and Practitioners using the OMSSS REST API</span></p>

    Once the client has completed the measure the Registration System can
    also use the <a href="#operation/Collection::notify">POST /collection/{uuid}/notify</a>
    endpoint to email a report of the results of the collection to an interested
    party such as a practitioner or Provider Organisation.

    ## Expiration and deletion of collections
    Collections will be expired in the OMSSS system according to the following rules:

    | Rule                                                                                               | Days |
    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------|
    | Days after creation that a client can no longer submit a collection                                | 28   |
    | Days after starting to answer before a client can no longer submit                                 | 7    |
    | Days after a client submits before an integrator can't retrieve or notify                          | 7    |
    | Days after after reaching any of the above rules that OMSSS will delete everything except the logs | 7    |

    Integrators can also request expiry of a collection using the
    <a href="#operation/Collection::expire">DELETE /collection/{uuid}</a> endpoint.
